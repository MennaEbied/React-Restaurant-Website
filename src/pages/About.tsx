                Founded in 2010, Samurai Sushi began as a small family-owned
                restaurant with a passion for authentic Japanese cuisine. Our
                master chef trained for over 15 years in Tokyo before bringing
                his expertise to create the perfect sushi experience.

                Today, we pride ourselves on using only the freshest
                ingredients, sourced locally when possible, and imported from
                Japan when necessary to maintain the highest quality and
                authenticity in every dish we serve.
